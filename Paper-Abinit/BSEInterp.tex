The accurate description of the dielectric function of crystal materials
requires state-of-the-art methodologies. The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) is
one of these techniques in the framework of the Many-Body Perturbation Theory,
including quasi-particles energies obtained from GW corrections and
electron-hole interaction (excitonic effects)~\cite{Onida2002}.
However, convergence of the dielectric properties reveals to be cumbersome as it 
requires a large number of wavevectors in the Brillouin Zone.

Therefore numerical techniques can be used to improve the convergence rate.
Rohlfing \& Louie~\cite{Rohlfing2000} developed a double-grid technique where 
the matrix elements of the BSE hamiltonian evaluated on a coarse grid are 
interpolated towards a denser grid. This allows to get at a lower price an 
approximation of the dielectric function on the dense grid.
In the spirit of this technique, we have generalized the
approach allowing for multilinear interpolation and designed 
efficient algorithms based on Lanczos-Haydock method~\cite{Gillet2015}.
Different schemes are also proposed in order to allow fine-tuning of the 
accuracy-computational load trade-off.

These new interpolation schemes are available in Abinit with the 
\texttt{bs\_interp\_*}
input variables and tests of these techniques are available in
\texttt{v67mbpt/t30-35}.
